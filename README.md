# Operating Calculator
You need to install `Colorama 0.4.4` using `pip`.

A calculator that can perform all sorts of calculations in a very intuitive UI.

Normally, in Python, we can calculate numbers. But it is a very old-fashioned and not very intuitive method. It is also not beginner friendly since you need to input all sorts of operators which you may not even know!

I bring to you *Operating Calculator*! Just input 2 numbers, choose your operation, and voila!

Supports upto 2 number calculations. (For calculations involving more than 2 numbers, first calculate them and then use the results in the final calculation.)

Choose between a wide range of operations, let it be Addition, Subtraction, etc. The choice is yours!
